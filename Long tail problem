What is Long tail?
In statistics and business, a long tail of some distributions of numbers is the portion of the distribution having a large number of occurrences far from the "head" or central part of the distribution.
The distribution could involve popularities, random numbers of occurrences of events with various probabilities, etc.[1] 
The term is often used loosely, with no definition or arbitrary definition, but precise definitions are possible.

In statistics, the term long-tailed distribution has a narrow technical meaning, and is a subtype of heavy-tailed distribution.[2][3][4] 
Intuitively, a distribution is (right) long-tailed if, for any fixed amount, when a quantity exceeds a high level, it almost certainly exceeds it by at least that amount: large quantities are probably even larger.[a] 
Note that there is no sense of the "long tail" of a distribution, but only the propertyof a distribution being long-tailed.

In business, the term long tail is applied to rank-size distributions or rank-frequency distributions (primarily of popularity), which often form power laws and are thus long-tailed distributions in the statistical sense. 
This is used to describe the retailing strategy of selling a large number of unique items with relatively small quantities sold of each (the "long tail")â€”usually in addition to selling fewer popular items in large quantities (the "head"). 
Sometimes an intermediate category is also included, variously called the body, belly, torso, or middle. 
The specific cutoff of what part of a distribution is the "long tail" is often arbitrary, but in some cases may be specified objectively; see segmentation of rank-size distributions.

The long tail concept has found some ground for application, research, and experimentation. 
It is a term used in online business, mass media, micro-finance (Grameen Bank, for example), user-driven innovation (Eric von Hippel), knowledge management, and social network mechanisms (e.g. crowdsourcing, crowdcasting, peer-to-peer), economic models, marketing (viral marketing), and IT Security threat hunting within a SOC (Information security operations center).

***********The longer tail over time********
A study by Erik Brynjolfsson, Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Michael D. Smith[17] finds that the long tail has grown longer over time, with niche books accounting for a larger share of total sales. 
Their analyses suggested that by 2008, niche books accounted for 36.7% of Amazon's sales while the consumer surplus generated by niche books has increased at least fivefold from 2000 to 2008. 
In addition, their new methodology finds that, while the widely used power laws are a good first approximation for the rank-sales relationship, the slope may not be constant for all book ranks, with the slope becoming progressively steeper for more obscure books.

In support of their findings, Wenqi Zhou and Wenjing Duan not only find a longer tail but also a fatter tail by an in-depth analysis on consumer software downloading pattern in their paper "Online user reviews, product variety, and the long tail"[1]. 
The demand for all products decreases, but the decrease for the hits is more pronounced, indicating the demand shifting from the hits to the niches over time. 
In addition, they also observe a superstar effect in the presence of the long tail. 
A small number of very popular products still dominates the demand.
