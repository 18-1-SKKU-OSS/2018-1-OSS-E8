What is rating site??
A rating site (less commonly, a rate-me site) is a website designed for users to vote on or rate people, content, or other things. 
Rating sites are typically organized around attributes such as physical appearance, body parts, voice, personality, etc. 
They may also be devoted to the subjects' occupational ability, for example teachers, professors, lawyers, doctors, etc.

Description
Rating sites typically show a series of images (or other content) in random fashion, or chosen by computer algorithm, rather than allowing users to choose. 
They then ask users for a rating or assessment, which is generally done quickly and without great deliberation. 
Users score items on a scale of 1 to 10, yes or no. Others, such as BabeVsBabe.com, ask users to choose between two pictures. 
Typically, the site gives instant feedback in terms of the item's running score, or the percentage of other users who agree with the assessment. They sometimes offer aggregate statistics or "best" and "worst" lists. Most allow users to submit their own image, sample, or other relevant content for others to rate. 
Some require the submission as a condition of membership.

Rating sites usually provide some features of social network services and online communities such as discussion forums messaging, and private messaging. Some function as a form of dating service, in that for a fee they allow users to contact other users. 
Many social networks and other sites include rating features.
For example, MySpace and TradePics have optional "rank" features for users to be rated by other users.
